# sys6018-competition-house-prices

## Objective:
The [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition on Kaggle is a test of advanced regression techniques. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## Methodology

### KNN Test
We ran a KNN Test upon the train data. To accomplish this we had to manipulate the data further. We excluded the non-numeric factors in the train and the test data. Doing this allowed us to chart out the points so as to begin the knn test. From there, we normalized the numeric data in both sets to even out the distance distributions. This then led to us running a regular knn test on the data. We chose to set the k at 38 due to its value as the square of observations. We also ran a regression knn regression since our numeric data was often continuous.
